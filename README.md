# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System  

## Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered medical diagnosis system** built using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface and **machine learning models** for disease prediction. It can predict diseases such as **diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, lung cancer, and hypothyroidism** based on patient input data.  

## Features  
âœ… **User-friendly interface** with an intuitive design  
âœ… **Multiple disease prediction** using trained machine learning models  
âœ… **Secure and reliable** processing of user data  
âœ… **Real-time diagnosis** with instant results  
âœ… **Background image and hidden UI elements** for enhanced aesthetics  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Model Storage:** Pickle files for trained ML models  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-medical-diagnosis.git
   cd ai-medical-diagnosis
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```  

## Future Improvements  
ðŸ”¹ Enhancing model accuracy with larger datasets  
ðŸ”¹ Adding more diseases for prediction  
ðŸ”¹ Implementing a database for user history tracking  
ðŸ”¹ Integrating real-time data collection via wearable devices
